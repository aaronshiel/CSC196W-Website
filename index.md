    <p><strong>Snowboarding</strong> is my favorite hobby. It's like therapy to me. There's nothing like carving fresh powder down a beautiful mountainside on an early morning. Because I used to skateboard, I, naturally, was drawn to the "park" sections of snowboarding resorts. These "parks" sometimes resemble a skatepark, but made of snow. I try to snowboard as much as I can every winter, but I need to get myself a truck or SUV with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive">4WD</a> to make the trip up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lake_Tahoe,_California">Tahoe</a> much safer.</p>
